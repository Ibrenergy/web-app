# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issue
The Next.js app was showing a 404 error when deployed to Vercel with the error:
`404: NOT_FOUND Code: NOT_FOUND ID: dxb1::jxq2l-1753798371856-0adc3beaeff4`

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by:
1. Client-side component dependencies that weren't properly resolved during build
2. Complex component imports using the `usePathname` hook
3. Potential circular dependencies between Layout components

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Component Architecture
- **Removed** complex Layout component with nested imports
- **Removed** Navigation component with client-side `usePathname` hook
- **Removed** Footer component dependencies
- **Inlined** all navigation and footer code directly in each page

### 2. Fixed ESLint Errors
- **Fixed** unescaped quotes by replacing `'` with `&apos;`
- **Removed** unused imports (`Image`, `Layout`)

### 3. Updated Configuration
- **Added** `vercel.json` with minimal configuration
- **Updated** `next.config.ts` with proper build settings
- **Updated** metadata in root layout for better SEO

### 4. Build Verification
- **Confirmed** all pages build as static content:
  - `/` (Home) - 164 B
  - `/about` - 164 B  
  - `/contact` - 2.21 kB (client component for form)
  - `/_not-found` - 993 B

## Current Structure
```
src/app/
├── page.tsx          # Home page (static)
├── about/page.tsx    # About page (static) 
├── contact/page.tsx  # Contact page (client component)
├── layout.tsx        # Root layout
└── globals.css       # Global styles
```

## Deployment Ready
The app now builds successfully with:
- ✅ No ESLint errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors  
- ✅ All pages statically generated
- ✅ Clean component dependencies
- ✅ Vercel-optimized configuration

## Next Steps
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to your connected Git repository
3. Vercel should automatically redeploy
4. The app should now load without 404 errors

The deployment should work correctly now with these fixes applied.
